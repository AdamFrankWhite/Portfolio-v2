                <p>
                    Serverless computing refers to the latest evolution of cloud
                    computing whereby backend services are managed by a cloud
                    provider on an on-demand, scalable, pay-as-you-go basis.
                    This is markedly different from traditional cloud computing
                    services, typically involving the renting of servers and
                    hardware on an ongoing basis, with the organisation paying
                    regardless of whether the hardware is utilised. The major
                    providers include Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure and
                    Google Cloud Platform, although there are open-source
                    alternatives like Apache OpenWhisk.
                </p>
                <h3>Serverless computing defined</h3>
                <p>
                    The term ‘serverless’ is often used synonymously with
                    Function-as-a-Service (FaaS), which provide on-demand code
                    execution – the most popular FaaS services include AWS
                    Lambda, Microsoft Azure Functions and Google Cloud
                    Functions. The serverless paradigm also encompasses managed
                    back-end services (BaaS) including data storage (e.g. S3),
                    databases (e.g. DynamoDB), notification systems,
                    authentication (Cognito) and much more.
                </p>
                <h3>Benefits of serverless vs serverful</h3>
                <p>
                    A prime use case for serverless is providing web API
                    services, handling requests and responses. The main strength
                    of serverless is scalability and the ability to scale to
                    zero, meaning you only pay for actual usage.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When renting traditional cloud computing hardware, most of
                    the cost is spent maintaining an idle server. Given typical
                    server utilisation is below 25%
                    (https://middleware.io/blog/efficient-server-utilization/),
                    switching to serverless solutions massively reduces
                    operating costs as businesses only pay for individual
                    function executions, fine-grained to the hundreds of
                    milliseconds.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Maintaining servers, ensuring adequate redundancy,
                    load-balancing and security measures is also costly and
                    burdensome to developers. Serverless computing solves these
                    issues by offloading those concerns to the cloud provider,
                    who leverage their considerable infrastructure to provide
                    robust security, performance and scalability, as well as
                    handling server maintenance and ensuring service
                    reliability.
                </p>
                <h3>Limitations</h3>
                <p>
                    This style of web application architecture does come with
                    its drawbacks, with the main disadvantages being cold starts
                    and vendor lock-in.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Cold start refers to the small delay it takes for a function
                    instance runtime environment to initialise, which for a
                    time-sensitive application could be critical. Nonetheless,
                    this issue can be mitigated through warm starts, where
                    functions are periodically initialised in anticipation of
                    incoming requests or through request pattern analysis.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Vendor lock-in refers to the increased likelihood of
                    becoming tied to a specific cloud provider as
                    interoperability with other platforms can be more difficult
                    or costly to configure.
                </p>
                <h3>Summary</h3>
                <p>
                    Gradually, businesses are moving to an increasingly
                    serverless architecture, building cloud-native applications
                    that take advantage of reduced operational costs, fast
                    scalability, high performance and reduced developer burden.
                    Ultimately, cloud providers are offering convenience and
                    reliability, at the expense of a loss of developer control
                    and vendor lock-in.
